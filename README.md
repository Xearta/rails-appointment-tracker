# Rails Appointment Tracker App

This is a small Rails application that allows a user (Physician) to create and maintain appointments with their 'Patients'. You can create as many users, patients, or appointments are you would like. 

This application allows you to create users through `Devise` or by 3rd party through **GitHub**. 

This application uses Rails as a back-end with ERB files for the views. 

**This project is not intended for professional usage.**


## Usage
To use this app, just clone, run rails `db:migrate` and then run `rails s` for the server. It will be hosted on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

*If you want pre-made data, you can run `rails db:seed` before starting the server.*
